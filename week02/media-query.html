        <h2>1 Corinthians 10:13</h2>
        <p>
            There hath no temptation taken you but such as is 
            common to man: but God is faithful, who will not 
            suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; 
            but will with the temptation also make a way to 
            escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
        </p>
        <h2>Alma 37:6</h2>
        <p>
            Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; 
            but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple 
            things are great things brought to pass; and small 
            means in many instances doth confound the wise.
